1-Movie and TV Show Recommender:
    web application that recommends movies and TV shows to users based on their preferences.
    The app could allow users to browse a list of popular movies and TV shows,
    search for specific titles, and receive personalized recommendations based on their viewing history
    and ratings.

    -main features:
        --A dashboard that displays recommended movies and TV shows based on the user's viewing history
          and ratings.

          when they become available.
        --A social component that allows users to connect with friends and share their favorite movies and
          TV shows.

    -extra features:
        --User Profiling: Instead of just using viewing history and ratings to generate recommendations,
          I could implement user profiling based on demographics, interests, and behavior patterns.
          This would involve collecting additional data about users, such as their age, gender, location,
          and social media activity, and using machine learning algorithms to create more accurate recommendations.
        
        --Personalized Search: To make it easier for users to find movies and TV shows they want to watch,
          I could implement a personalized search feature. This would allow users to search for movies
          and TV shows based on their interests, viewing history, and ratings, and would generate personalized
          search results based on their search queries.

        --Social Network Integration: To add a social component to the app, I could integrate it with social
          networks like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. This would allow users to connect with friends,
          share their viewing history and ratings, and receive recommendations from their social network.
